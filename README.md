# Avocado Market Intelligence System

## Repository Name

**avocado-market-intelligence**

---

## Description

Institutional‑grade market intelligence and analytics engine that performs structural, statistical, temporal, and predictive analysis on avocado market data using advanced statistical methods, machine learning, and signal processing. The system automatically generates executive‑level charts and produces a fully formatted intelligence report in PDF format.

This project replicates hedge‑fund‑style analytics pipelines by combining:

* Statistical analysis
* Signal processing
* Machine learning
* Structural regime detection
* Feature importance analysis
* Seasonality and frequency decomposition
* Volatility and anomaly detection
* Executive report generation

The system transforms raw historical data into actionable intelligence.
